World ID is a protocol that lets you **prove a human is doing an action only once without revealing any personal data**. World ID uses a device called the [Orb](https://worldcoin.org/how-the-launch-works) which takes a picture of a person's iris to verify they are a unique and alive human. The protocol only requires a hash-equivalent (i.e. irreversible) of the iris to be stored (which happens on a blockchain). The protocol uses [Zero-knowledge proofs](https://id.worldcoin.org/zkp) for all World ID verification, so no information (not even about other World ID verifications) is ever shared.

World ID can be used both on-chain and off-chain (Cloud). World ID even supports IRL verification. Go to the [World ID app][app] to get started.
