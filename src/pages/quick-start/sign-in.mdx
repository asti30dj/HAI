# Sign In with Worldcoin

Sign In with Worldcoin (SIWC) is built to bring the privacy benefits of World ID to a broad range of apps as easily as possible. It is a simple, drop-in authentication mechanism that works with any OIDC-compatible authentication engine.

The two simplest ways to get started with SIWC are to use our integration on the [Auth0 Marketplace](https://worldcoin.org/auth0) or our [NextAuth Template Repository](https://github.com/worldcoin). {/*TODO: build template repository and update link*/}
- Use the [Auth0 Integration](https://worldcoin.org/auth0) if you use Auth0 as your authentication engine.
- Use the [NextAuth Template Repository](https://github.com/worldcoin) to build a Next.js app with SIWC authentication or to add SIWC to an existing Next.js app.

<Note>
    If your app uses a different OIDC-compatible authentication engine, you can configure it to use SIWC with our `.well-known` file. [Read more here](/sign-in).

        Follow the [Auth0 Integration](https://worldcoin.org/auth0) installation instructions to add SIWC to your Auth0 Tenant using the Client ID and Client Secret found in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org).
        <Note>
            If your app hasn't yet integrated Auth0, you can use any of their [various SDK libraries](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries) to get started. This allows using SIWC on a very broad range of platforms, including web, mobile, and desktop apps.

        1. Create a new repository from our [World ID NextAuth Template Repository](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-nextauth-template).

        2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local`, and add your Client ID and Client Secret to the `.env.local` file in your new repository. You can find these in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org).

        3. Add the app's URL to the list of allowed redirect URIs in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org). For example, if your app is hosted at `https://example.com`, add `https://example.com/api/auth/callback/worldcoin` to the list of allowed redirect URIs.
            
        <Note>
            You must use a Staging App to use `localhost` as part of a redirect URI. For this example, you'd use `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/worldcoin` as the redirect URI.
        </Note>

        4. Run `pnpm i && pnpm dev` to install dependencies and run the app locally, or deploy the app to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
