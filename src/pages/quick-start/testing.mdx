# Testing your Integration

To test your integration, we provide the [Worldcoin Simulator](https://simulator.worldcoin.org) to simulate a user using World App in a staging environment.

You can use the simulator from another browser tab and copy the QR code from IDKit with a single click:

<video className="m-auto" width="320" height="240" autoPlay muted loop playsInline>
    <source src="/images/docs/introduction/qr-copy.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

And then paste the QR code data into the simulator:

<video className="m-auto" width="320" height="240" autoPlay muted loop playsInline>
    <source src="/images/docs/introduction/qr-paste.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

You should see a successful outcome in IDKit!
