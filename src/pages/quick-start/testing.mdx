# Testing your App

To develop and test with World ID, you can set up **staging** apps. Staging apps use the protocol's staging network. This network is intended to aid with development, and it provides more flexibility to create new identities, issue credentials and try different edge cases.

The staging network uses a separate infrastructure and has the following key characteristics:

-   Identities and credentials are managed in the [World ID Simulator](https://simulator.worldcoin.org). The Simulator is used instead of the World App or other clients.
-   Proofs can be verified using the Debugger tab in the Developer Portal.
-   For on-chain verifications, the World ID smart contract is deployed to three testnets: Ethereum Goerli, Optimism Goerli, and Polygon Mumbai. [Read more here](/reference/contracts).

<Note>
	Use the [Worldcoin Simulator](https://simulator.worldcoin.org) to access test identities and credentials.

## Using the Staging network

Using the staging network as an end user is simple, just go to the [World ID Simulator](https://simulator.worldcoin.org) on either a mobile device or a desktop browser.

1. Select a staging identity. All staging identities are Phone- and Orb-verified.
2. Scan or paste a QR code generated by the IDKit Widget in your app.
	- If you are testing your on desktop, you can click the QR code to copy it to your clipboard to paste into the Simulator.
3. Select which credentials you want to use for this action. You can select Phone or Orb (or even neither, if you wish to test that edge case).

### Verifying proofs

	If your action is running on Cloud, all you have to do is **ensure you're using the Staging app's App ID**. When you create an action you select whether you want to run it in staging or production mode, and the Developer Portal will do the proper validation automatically for you in [the Debugger](https://developer.worldcoin.org).

  <TabItem value="on-chain" label="On-chain verification">
    If you are running your action on-chain, you do need to point your smart contract to the relevant staging World ID smart contract. Further, the Staging and Production smart contracts are deployed to different chains. Follow these guidelines:

	- Make sure to deploy your contract on one of the supported testnets: Ethereum Goerli, Optimism Goerli, or Polygon Mumbai.
		- You can find the [contract addresses here](/anonymous-actions/on-chain#contract-addresses). Check the [smart contract verification template](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-onchain-template) and [On-Chain Verification](/anonymous-actions/on-chain) documentation for details.
	- When interacting with your smart contract, remember to connect your wallet to the testnet you selected.
