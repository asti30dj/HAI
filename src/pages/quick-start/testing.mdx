# Testing with the World ID Simulator

<Note type="warning">
	On-chain apps will see a delay of 5-30 minutes for verifications of new identities. If you're testing an on-chain app, please reference the [On-Chain Verification](/anonymous-actions/on-chain) documentation for details.
</Note>

To develop and test with World ID, you can set up **staging** apps. Staging apps use the protocol's staging network. This network is intended to aid with development, and it provides more flexibility to create new identities, issue credentials and try different edge cases.

The staging network uses a separate infrastructure and has the following key characteristics:

-   Identities and credentials are managed in the [World ID Simulator](https://simulator.worldcoin.org). The Simulator is used instead of the World App or other clients.
-   Proofs can be verified using the Debugger tab in the Developer Portal.
-   For on-chain verifications, the World ID smart contract is deployed to the Polygon Mumbai-Testnet.

<Note>
	Access the World ID Simulator at [https://simulator.worldcoin.org][simulator] to generate test identities and
	credentials.
</Note>

## Using the Staging network

Using the staging network as an end user is simple, just go to the [World ID Simulator][simulator] on either a mobile device or a desktop browser.

1. Create or load a staging identity. Read more about [identity generation here](#about-identity-generation).
2. Get your Orb credential by verifying your identity within the Simulator.
	- Note that it may take identities 3-5 minutes to be verified.
3. Scan or paste a QR code generated by the IDKit Widget.
	- If you are testing your on desktop, you can click the QR code to copy it to your clipboard to paste into the Simulator.

### Verifying proofs

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cloud" label="Cloud verification" default>
	If your action is running on Cloud, all you have to do is **ensure you're using the Staging app's App ID**. When you create an action you select whether you want to run it in staging or production mode and the Developer Portal will do the proper validation automatically for you in [the Debugger](https://developer.worldcoin.org).
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="on-chain" label="On-chain verification">
    If you are running your action on-chain, you do need to point your smart contract to the relevant staging World ID smart contract. Further, the Staging and Production smart contracts are deployed to different chains. Follow these guidelines:

<ol>
	<li>
		Make sure to deploy your contract in the [Polygon
		Mumbai-Testnet](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/network-details/network/).
	</li>
	<li>
		Obtain the World ID contract address from ENS. The smart contract can be found
		at [`mumbai.id.worldcoin.eth`](https://etherscan.io/name-lookup-search?id=mumbai.id.worldcoin.eth) and point to it in your smart contract. Check the [smart contract verification template](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-onchain-template) and [On-Chain Verification](/anonymous-actions/on-chain) documentation for details.
		<ul>
			<li>
				You will have to do the address resolving manually or with a deploy script as there's no ENS on Polygon.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		When interacting with your smart contract remember to connect your wallet to the <b>Polygon Mumbai-Testnet.</b>
	</li>
</ol>

## About identity generation

When you use the simulator you are required to generate or load a World ID identity first. You can either generate a temporary identity which is stored on `localStorage` and persisted until you log out or clear your browser storage, or generate an identity with any ETH wallet for stronger persistence.

When you generate an identity with an external wallet, we use a signature from your wallet to generate the seed entropy for your identity. This means, if you ever use the same wallet again on the simulator, the same World ID identity will be generated, which can help with persistence and working across devices. **Your wallet's private key is never exposed to the simulator.**

<Note>If you don't have a verified World ID yet, the staging network is a great way to try things out.</Note>

The **staging sequencer** (used to submit _verified identities_ to the staging Semaphore contract and obtain Merkle proof information) uses a `Basic` authorization token. The endpoints can be found in [Protocol Internals](/advanced/protocol-internals#staging).

The **staging World ID smart contract** (also called the _Staging Semaphore instance_) is hosted on the **Polygon Mumbai-Testnet network** and the contract address can be found at:

-   `staging.semaphore.wld.eth` for Orb credentials
-   `staging.phone.wld.eth` for phone credentials

Always do an ENS lookup for the most up-to-date information. */}
