# Choosing your Integration

There are two main ways to integrate World ID into your app:
- [Sign In with Worldcoin](/quick-start/sign-in): Use World ID as an authentication mechanism, similar to Sign In with Google.
- [Anonymous Actions](/quick-start/aa): Use World ID to verify a user is doing something only once, for a particular context.

Both are built on top of the same underlying technology, but they are designed for different use cases. Here are some tips on when to use (or not use) each one.

### Sign In with Worldcoin
SIWC is built to bring the privacy benefits of World ID to a broad range of apps as easily as possible. It is a simple, drop-in authentication mechanism that works with any OIDC-compatible authentication engine.
- âœ… When to use SIWC:
  - You want to know that an account belongs to a real person, and each real person only has one account.
  - You already use Auth0, NextAuth, or a similar authentication engine in your app.
  - You want to allow users to preserve their privacy, or even stay completely anonymous.
- ðŸš« When **not** to use SIWC:
  - Your app has an on-chain component (e.g. a smart contract).
  - You want a user to be able to have multiple accounts and keep them separate.
  - You want to verify a user is doing a specific action only once.

### Anonymous Actions
Anonymous Actions are a powerful tool for sybil-resistance both on and off-chain. They allow you to verify a user is doing something only once, for a particular context. For example, you can verify a person is claiming a particular airdrop just once.
- âœ… When to use Anonymous Actions:
  - You want to verify a user is doing something only once, for a particular context.
  - Your user will be taking multiple discrete actions (e.g. claiming multiple airdrops, voting on multiple proposals, etc.) and you want to allow each action to be done only once.
  - Your app interacts with a smart contract on-chain.
- ðŸš« When **not** to use Anonymous Actions:
  - You want to use World ID for authentication or identification of a user. (See [Sign In with Worldcoin](#sign-in-with-worldcoin) above.)

<Note>
You also must choose which credentials you want to accept. By default, only Orb credentials are accepted. A good rule of thumb is to pick the minimal credential for which the cost of sybil attacking is higher than the received benefit. [Read more here.](/proof-of-personhood#available-credentials)
