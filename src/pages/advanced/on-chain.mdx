# On-Chain

World ID proofs can be fully verified on-chain. After all, the source of truth for the decentralized protocol is on-chain. To verify a World ID proof, your smart contract will embed a call to the `verifyProof` method of the World ID contract, and then execute the rest of its logic as usual.

We provide a [Foundry starter kit](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-starter) and a [Hardhat starter kit](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-starter-hardhat) to help you get started with World ID. We strongly recommend using one of these starter kits to get started with World ID.

<Note type="warning">
	Note that calling the `verifyProof` function by itself does not provide sybil-resistance, or prevent proof reuse, it
	just verifies that the proof is valid. To prevent sybil attacks, see the [sybil-resistance
	section](#sybil-resistance) below.

## Calling verifyProof

<Note>
	The `verifyProof` function is meant to be called by your smart contract. If you just want to verify a proof from
	your backend, you should use the [/verify method of the API](/api) instead.
</Note>

The `verifyProof` method takes the following arguments:

-   `root` - The World ID root to verify against. This is obtained from the IDKit widget, and should just be passed as-is.
-   `groupId` - This should always be `1` for World ID.
-   `signal` - The signal to verify. See the [signal section](#custom-signals) below.
-   `nullifierHash` - Anonymous user ID. This is obtained from the IDKit widget, and should just be passed as-is.
-   `action` - The action to verify. See the [action section](#custom-actions) below.
-   `proof` - The proof to verify. This is obtained from the IDKit widget, and should be unpacked into a `uint256[8]` before being passed to the method.

The `proof` argument is returned from IDKit as a string, but depending how you're calling your smart contract (when using `ethers.js` or `wagmi`, for example), you might be required to unpack it into a `uint256[8]` before passing it to the `verifyProof` method. To unpack it, use the following code:

```ts
import { defaultAbiCoder as abi } from '@ethers/utils'

const unpackedProof = abi.decode(['uint256[8]'], proof)[0]
```

The `verifyProof` method reverts if the proof is invalid, meaning you can just call it as part of your smart contract's logic and execute the rest of your logic after as usual.

## Custom signals

Signals can be used to validate that a transaction has not been tampered with. By including other parameters your smart contract expects in the signal, you can ensure that the proof verification is only successful if those other parameters haven't been tampered with.

For example, a smart contract performing an airdrop might include the receiver address in the signal, while a contract allowing users to vote on a governance proposal might include the vote.

To get started, you'll need to pass the signal to the IDKit widget. You can do this with the `signal` prop:

```tsx focus=1,6
import { solidityEncode } from '@worldcoin/idkit'

return (
	<IDKitWidget
		// ...
		signal={solidityEncode(['address'], [receiverAddress])}
	>
		{/* ... */}
	</IDKitWidget>
)
```

Then, in your smart contract, you `abi.encodePacked` the signal and [call `hashToField` on it](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-starter/blob/main/src/helpers/ByteHasher.sol).

```solidity
worldId.verifyProof(
    // ...
    abi.encodePacked(receiverAddress).hashToField(),
    // ...
);
```

## Custom actions

Actions are key to uniqueness on the World ID protocol. The same action will provide the same `nullifierHash` for the same user. By default, your action will be your app id, `abi.encodePacked` and [hashed to field](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-starter/blob/main/src/helpers/ByteHasher.sol).

```solidity
uint256 action = abi.encodePacked(appId).hashToField();
```

If you want to use a custom action, you can pass it to the IDKit widget with the `action` prop:

```tsx focus=1,4,6
import { solidityEncode } from '@worldcoin/idkit'

return (
	<IDKitWidget app_id={appId} action={solidityEncode(['uint256'], [proposalId])}>
		{/* ... */}
	</IDKitWidget>
)
```

Then, in your smart contract, you `abi.encodePacked` the action and [call `hashToField` on it](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-starter/blob/main/src/helpers/ByteHasher.sol).

```solidity
// we recommend memoizing the appId part on the constructor to save gas
uint256 action = abi.encodePacked(abi.encodePacked(appId).hashToField(), proposalId).hashToField();
```

<Note>
	To put together the two examples below, an application that lets users vote on governance proposals anonymously (but
	only lets them vote once) would add the proposal id to the action and the contents of the vote to the signal.
</Note>

## Sybil-resistance

While the World ID protocol makes it very easy to make your contracts sybil-resistant, this takes a little more than just calling the `verifyProof` function. To make your contract sybil-resistant, you'll need to do the following:

-   Store the `nullifierHash` of each user that has successfully verified a proof.
-   When a user attempts to verify a proof, check that the `nullifierHash` is not already in the list of used `nullifierHash`es.

Here's an example function doing the above. You can also use the [World ID starter kits](#on-chain) to get started with sybil-resistance.

```solidity
/// @param signal An arbitrary input from the user, usually the user's wallet address
/// @param root The root (returned by the IDKit widget).
/// @param nullifierHash The nullifier hash for this proof, preventing double signaling (returned by the IDKit widget).
/// @param proof The zero-knowledge proof that demonstrates the claimer is registered with World ID (returned by the IDKit widget).
function verifyAndExecute(
    address signal,
    uint256 root,
    uint256 nullifierHash,
    uint256[8] calldata proof
) public {
    // First, we make sure this person hasn't done this before
    if (nullifierHashes[nullifierHash]) revert InvalidNullifier();

    // We now verify the provided proof is valid and the user is verified by World ID
    worldId.verifyProof(
        root,
        1,
        abi.encodePacked(signal).hashToField(),
        nullifierHash,
        abi.encodePacked(appId).hashToField(),
        proof
    );

    // We now record the user has done this, so they can't do it again (proof of uniqueness)
    nullifierHashes[nullifierHash] = true;

    // Finally, execute your logic here, for example issue a token, NFT, etc...
}
```

## Network support

The World ID protocol currently lives in the Polygon network, and the verifier contract is deployed at `semaphore.wld.eth` on Polygon mainnet and `staging.semaphore.wld.eth` on Polygon Mumbai testnet.

We will very soon be launching the World ID protocol on Ethereum mainnet and Optimism, and will update this documentation accordingly.
