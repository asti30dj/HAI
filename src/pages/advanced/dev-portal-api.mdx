# Managing the Developer Portal with GraphQL

## API Keys

<Note>You can generate API Keys on the **My Team** page of the Developer Portal.</Note>

-   API keys are intended for use by third-party applications and for server-to-server communication. They are long-lived and can be revoked at any time.
-   API keys are scoped to a team and have full permissions for any actions as any user of the Developer Portal.
-   Once you have an API key, use it as the value of the `Authorization` header in your requests. For example:

```
Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY
```

Interaction with the Developer Portal API is mostly done through a GraphQL endpoint, which enables retrieving information and interacting with any of the API objects. You can read more about [queries](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/api-reference/graphql-api/query/) and [mutations](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/api-reference/graphql-api/mutation/) for GraphQL to help you construct your query.

<CodeGroup title="Example Queries">

```graphql {{ title: "Listing Apps" }}
query MyApps {
	app {
		id
		name
	}
}
```

```graphql {{ title: "Listing nullifiers for action" }}
query ActionNullifiers($action_id: String) {
	action(where: { id: { _eq: $action_id }, status: { _eq: "active" } }) {
		id
		status
		max_accounts_per_user
		max_verifications
		nullifiers {
			nullifier_hash
		}
	}
}
