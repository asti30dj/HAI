# Zero-knowledge proofs


## Introduction 

Zero-Knowledge Proofs is a cryptographic mechanism to prove a secret without revealing it to the verifier.
This is possible through the use of complex math under the hood. Thanks to the cryptographers
who worked on the moonmath for us . 

A simple example is to cryptographically prove you are above 18 years of age .

A Zk Proof should have the following 3 properties:
- Completeness: If you are above 18 , verifier will be convinced with a high probability
- Soundness: Very low probability of cheating 
- Zero knowledge: Your exact age is not shared

## How does WorldCoin makes use of Zero Knowledge Proofs?

After the orb scans your Iris, your unique identity is added to the pool of Unique humans.
Everytime you want to prove your identity, you can prove that you are a part of the pool , without revealing any 
extra information.

## Use Cases  

- Proof of Personhood: WorldCoin
- Scaling L1s: ZkEvm( Polygon,Zksync,Scroll)
- Fund Mixers in public Blockchains: Tornado Cash
