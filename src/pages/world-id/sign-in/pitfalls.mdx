# Sign In with World ID Common Pitfalls

<br/>

## Invalid Redirect URI

Ensure you've added your application's sign in callback URL to the list of allowed Redirect URIs in the Developer Portal.

<Note>Redirect URIs using `http`, `localhost`, or port numbers are only allowed for Staging applications.</Note>

```{{ title: 'Redirect URI Example' }}
https://example.com/path/to/auth/calback/worldcoin
```
```{{ title: 'Next.js example' }}
https://example.com/api/auth/callback
``` 

## Unauthenticated Errors

Ensure your Client ID and Client Secret are properly set in your environment variables according to your authentication library's documentation.

<Note>The Client Secret should never be exposed in client-side code. If accidentally committed to your codebase, you should rotate the client secret in the Developer Portal.</Note>
