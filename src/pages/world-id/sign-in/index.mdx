import { Link } from '@/components/Link'

# Overview

In almost all situations you should use <Link href="/world-id/id/cloud">Verify</Link> instead of Sign in. 
Sign In with World ID creates new users accounts and you should only use if if you don't plan to collect
any additional information. Furthermore, if you are building a native application, you will need to use a third party
OIDC implementation which has behavior that we cannot control. Thus it is advised for you to use <Link href="/world-id/id/libraries">IDKit</Link>. 

It is optimal to use cloud verification. The flow that we suggest is to use your existing login and then
allow users to verify their uniqueness on their existing account using <Link href="/world-id/id/cloud">Verify</Link>
