World ID is a digital passport that lets a user prove they are a unique and real person while remaining anonymous. This happens through [Zero-knowledge Proofs](/advanced/zero-knowledge-proofs) and other privacy-preserving cryptographic mechanisms.

You can easily integrate World ID in your app and smart contract or backend. World ID holders can easily and anonymously verify they are a unique human through a compatible identity wallet, like the [World App](https://worldcoin.org/download).

## How it works

In broad strokes, this is how World ID works.

1. User gets their World ID in a compatible wallet (e.g. the [World App](https://worldcoin.org/download)).

2. User receives credentials in their World ID. The flagship credential is biometric verification, currently available by using the [Orb](https://github.com/worldcoin/orb-hardware). The user can also verify their phone number to obtain the respective credential.

3. Project [integrates with World ID](/quick-start).

4. User connects their World ID to authenticate, and optionally prove they are a unique human doing something only once. The user's wallet will generate a [Zero-Knowledge Proof](/advanced/zero-knowledge-proofs) to accomplish this.

5. Project verifies the [Zero-knowledge Proof](/advanced/zero-knowledge-proofs), either by using the [API](/api) or by verifying [on-chain](/advanced/on-chain).

## Use cases

World ID unlocks a vast number of applications and use cases. You can find a list of community-curated ideas [here](/use-cases).
