World ID is a way to anonymously verify someone is an actual person performing an action, and that they have performed that action only once (without revealing anything about themselves). This happens through [Zero-knowledge proofs](/advanced/zero-knowledge-proofs).

You can easily integrate World ID in your app and smart contract or backend. End user can easily and anonymously verify they are a unique human through the [World app](https://worldcoin.org/download).

## How it works

In broad strokes, this is how World ID works.

<img
  src="/images/docs/introduction/how-it-works-light.svg"
  className="block"
  alt="Render of World ID widget"
/>

1. End user verifies themself at a Worldcoin orb ([read more](https://worldcoin.org/how-the-launch-works)). User proves they are a unique human without requiring to store any PII (more on [Privacy](/about/privacy)).

2. Project [integrates with World ID](/quick-start).

3. Whenever performing a specific [action](/about/protocol#what-are-actions), user proves they are a unique human by submitting a [Zero-knowledge proof](/docs/advanced/zero-knowledge-proofs) from the Worldcoin app.

4. Project validates the [Zero-knowledge proof](/advanced/zero-knowledge-proofs) and executes the action (e.g. token airdrop, NFT minting, account creation, ...).

Read more about how World ID works in the [Protocol](/about/protocol) section.

## Use cases

World ID prevents sybil attacks both on-chain and off-chain. Some use cases:

  className="block"
  alt="Use-cases for World ID"
/>

<div className="sr-only">

- **Receiving airdrops**. Reward early users of your project without abuse
  from bots, users creating multiple accounts, etc. For example, democratic
  airdrops like [Worldcoin](https://worldcoin.org).
- **Democratic voting**.
  Ensure one person equals one vote; e.g. governance, proposal voting, etc.
- **Quadratic funding**. Funding where the number of contributors matter more
  than the sheer number of dollars provided (to democratize the process). Ensure
  a single person only funds a project once. An example of quadratic funding is
  [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-grants-quadratic-funding-for-the-world/).
- **Person-bound NFTs**. Enables the possibility of blockchain-based records
  (e.g. university degrees, vaccination records, citizenship confirmation, ...).
  Without World ID you could transfer those NFTs to a third party which would
  make the records useless.
