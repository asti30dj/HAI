# Incognito Actions

You can create _Incognito Actions_ to verify any arbitrary action a user might take in your app, where each action is independent of other actions. Some examples include:

-   Claiming a one-time discount for a purchase (each discount is independent of other discounts)
-   Allowing users to vote in a poll, but only vote per user (each vote is independent, votes from the same person cannot be linked)
-   Sharing an invitation to join a platform, limited to five total invites

The basic flow is as follows:

<div className="grid gap-y-4">
	<Steps
		borders
		steps={[
			<span>Your app connects to the user's device through IDKit and requests verification.</span>,
			<span>
				User generates a <a href="/advanced/zero-knowledge-proofs">ZKP</a> on their device, using their World ID
				credentials.
			</span>,
			<span>
				Your app verifies that proof from the user's device with our API or smart contract.
			</span>,
		]}
	/>
</div>

To demonstrate the power of actions, take the voting example. Imagine you are building a website to host polls for a local organization, but you'd like votes to be anonymous. By using a new action for each vote, you can enforce that users only vote once in each ballot, while also ensuring that there is no way to correlate a user's cast ballots across votes.
