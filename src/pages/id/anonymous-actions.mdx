# Anonymous Actions

The World ID protocol provides developers flexibility in the types of actions they would like to verify. In addition to sign in, developers can create _anonymous actions_ to verify any arbitrary action a user might take in their applications. Some examples include:

- Claim a one-time discount for a purchase
- Allow user's to vote in a poll, but only vote per user
- Share an invitation to join a platform, limited to five total invites

## Configuration

Anonymous actions can either be configured via the developer portal, or on-the-fly through [IDKit](/js). Either approach provides the same feature set. Creating actions on the Developer Portal is generally recommended, but setting on-the-fly is best for dynamic contexts. For example, this feature is used in [Discord Bouncer](https://discordbouncer.com) to generate an action for each Discord server that installs the bot, because we don't know all the servers in advance.

### Developer Portal

Once your application is registered in the developer portal, you may add additional actions to it by navigating to the "Anonymous Actions" page:

![TODO]

Once selected, click the "Create New" button and fill out the necessary fields. The "Description" field is shown to your user in the World app as they sign with their World ID, alongside your application logo. Make sure to fully describe the exact action the user is taking.

You can also specify the number of times a user can complete an action, or allow an unlimited amount of verifications to take place.

Once complete, make sure you pass the same registered value for `action` to [IDKit in it's props](TODO).

### On-The-Fly

To accommodate dynamic content, actions can also be created on-the-fly as a user completes a World ID verification. Simply pass the desired `action` value in [IDKit's props](TODO). A new action will automatically be created and tracked, and will appear the next time you log into the developer portal.

As an example, a custom action version of IDKit may look like:

```jsx
const getUserChoice = (userId) => {
  const choice = userChoices['userId']
  return choice
}

return (
  <IDKitWidget
    app_id="app_staging_7550e829082fc558e112e0620c1c7a59"
    action={userId + getUserChoice(userId)}
    signal=""
    onSuccess={onSuccess}
    handleVerify={handleProof}
  />
)
```
