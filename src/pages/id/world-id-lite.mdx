# World ID Lite

World ID Lite is replacing the previous `phone` credential in World ID. World ID Lite relies on the user's identity wallet, such as World App, to verify a user's unique device.

The premise of World ID Lite is users having a unique mobile device. This is more scalable, user friendly, and privacy-preserving than the previous `phone` credential, which was issued when a user verified their phone number in World App.

## When to use World ID Lite vs. World ID Orb

World ID Lite offers an assurance that's convenient for a user to obtain, but it also provides a weaker level of resistance to Sybil attacks than World ID's Orb credential. It's best used for applications that only require a moderate level of sybil resistance or have a significant user base in regions where the Orb is not available.

For example, a gaming application that wants to prevent many bot accounts from being created would be a great use case for World ID Lite. However, an undercollateralized lending application would likely want to use World ID's Orb credential, as it provides a strong level of Sybil resistance.
