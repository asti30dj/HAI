# Intro to IDKit

<Note>This guide assumes you have already completed the steps to [set up the Developer Portal](/quick-start).</Note>

IDKit is required in your app's frontend for Anonymous Actions, both for Cloud and On-Chain use cases.

## Creating actions

Create an action for your app in the Developer Portal. You must provide the following values:

    -   **Action Name**: The stringified action to be taken by the user.
    -   **Description**: This is shown to your user in the World app as they sign with their World ID. Make sure to fully describe the exact action the user is taking.
    -   **Max Verifications**: _For Cloud actions only_. The number of times a user can take this action. A value of `0` indicates that unlimited verifications can take place.

<Note>
	An action scopes uniqueness for users, which means users will always generate the same ID (nullifier hash) when
	performing the same action. **Cloud actions** natively handle sybil-resistance with a limit set in the Developer
	Portal. For **on-chain** use cases, you can track this nullifier hash in your smart contract to [implement
	sybil-resistance](/id/on-chain#sybil-resistance).
</Note>

## Installing IDKit

The JS package can be included in your project either as a module (which supports tree shaking to reduce bundle size) or you can add the script directly to your website.

<CodeGroup title="Install IDKit">

    ```bash {{ title: "npm" }}
    npm install @worldcoin/idkit
    ```

    ```bash {{ title: "yarn" }}
    yarn add @worldcoin/idkit
    ```

    ```bash {{ title: "pnpm" }}
    pnpm add @worldcoin/idkit
    ```

</CodeGroup>

## Usage

Import and render IDKit. You'll want to do this on the screen where the user executes the protected action (e.g. before they click "Claim airdrop" or "Vote on proposal").

```tsx
import { IDKitWidget } from '@worldcoin/idkit'
<IDKitWidget
	app_id="app_GBkZ1KlVUdFTjeMXKlVUdFT" // obtained from the Developer Portal
	action="vote_1" // this is your action name from the Developer Portal
	onSuccess={onSuccess} // callback when the modal is closed
	handleVerify={handleVerify} // optional callback when the proof is received
	credential_types={['orb', 'device']} // optional, defaults to ['orb']
>
	{({ open }) => <button onClick={open}>Verify with World ID</button>}
</IDKitWidget>
```

More configuration options can be found in the [IDKit reference](/reference/idkit).

When a user clicks the button, the IDKit modal will open and prompt them to scan a QR code and verify with World ID. Once this proof is received, the optional `handleVerify` callback is called immediately and the `onSuccess` callback will be called when the modal is closed.
One of these callbacks should begin the process of verifying the proof.

### IDKit with Dynamic Actions

To accommodate dynamic content, actions can also be created at the time a user completes a World ID verification. Simply pass the desired `action` and `action_description` values in [IDKit's parameters](/reference/idkit#parameters). A new action will automatically be created and tracked, and will appear the next time you log into the Developer Portal.

<Note> If using dynamic actions on-chain, you will need to re-calculate the `externalNullifierHash` for each action you wish to verify. Read more [here](/further-reading/protocol-internals#external-nullifier). </Note>

As an example, using IDKit with Dynamic Actions may look like this:

```jsx
const getUserChoice = userId => {
	const choice = userChoices['userId']
	return choice
}

return (
	<IDKitWidget
        {/* ... */}
		action={getUserChoice(userId)}
        {/* ... */}
    >
    </IDKitWidget>
)
```

## Response

Upon successful completion of the World ID flow, you will receive a response object. This response object of type `ISuccessResult` has the following attributes. **Normally, you will forward these parameters to your backend or smart contract for verification.**

```json {{ title: 'ISuccessResult' }}
{
	"merkle_root": "0x1f38b57f3bdf96f05ea62fa68814871bf0ca8ce4dbe073d8497d5a6b0a53e5e0",
	"nullifier_hash": "0x0339861e70a9bdb6b01a88c7534a3332db915d3d06511b79a5724221a6958fbe",
	"proof": "0x063942fd7ea1616f17787d2e3374c1826ebcd2d41d2394...",
	"credential_type": "orb"
}
```

<Properties>
	<Property name="merkle_root" type="string">
		This is the hash pointer to the root of the Merkle tree that proves membership of the user's identity in the
		list of identities verified by the Orb. ABI encoded.
	</Property>
	<Property name="nullifier_hash" type="string">
		The unique identifier for this combination of user, app, and action. ABI encoded.
	</Property>
	<Property name="proof" type="string">
		The Zero-knowledge proof of the verification. ABI encoded.
	</Property>
	<Property name="credential_type" type='"orb" | "device"'>
		Either `orb` or `device`. Will always return the strongest credential with which a user has been verified.
	</Property>
</Properties>

## Verify the Proof

<Note type="warning">
	You must verify the proof returned from IDKit with the API or smart contract before allowing a user to perform an
	action. The process varies depending on your use case. Proceed to the [Cloud Verification](/id/cloud) or [On-Chain
	Verification](/id/on-chain) sections to learn how to verify proofs.
