# Overview

World ID is a privacy-preserving, proof-of-personhood protocol. It allows verified users to _trustlessly prove_ that they are a unique human, and optionally perform a given action once. This is accomplished with a combination of blockchain technology and zero-knowledge proofs.

## How does it work?

World ID begins within the World app. When a user verifies at an Orb (or via phone), a _secret identity_ is generated on-device, where it is securely stored. Additionally, a public _identity commitment_ is published to the Ethereum blockchain, which acts at the source of truth for the protocol. These two values are used as inputs to each World ID verification, specifically as part of the [zero knowledge proof](/advanced/zero-knowledge-proofs).

The World app generates a zero knowledge proof for every verification a user makes. Verifications cannot be correlated across applications or actions, which means that the user's privacy is ensured by cryptography.

After a user verifies, a _nullifier hash_ is returned to the application, and can be treated as a user ID. Nullifiers are unique to the application, and cannot be correlating, even amongst colluding applications. If a developer wants users to be able to take additional actions in a privacy-preserving way, they can do so with [Anonymous Actions](/id/anonymous-actions).

## Developer Portal

Applications within the World ID protocol must first be registered with the [Worldcoin Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org). The portal provides a simple UI to manage applications, actions, and user metrics. The portal is the easist way to verify the proofs returned by [IDKit](/idkit/index), and performs much of the on-chain lookups for the integrating application.

Additionally, those familar with OpenID Connect will be please to hear that World ID can serve as your [Identity Provider](/id/sign-in)! We support all of the most common integrations, such as Auth0 and Cloudflare.

## Proof-of-Personhood

The protocol enables many usecases for these new types of credentials. A user's World app, once verified by an Orb, can be used to assert to any application that the holder is human beyond-a-doubt. All verified user's must be unique, thanks to the advanced imaging methods used by the [Orb hardware](https://github.com/worldcoin/orb-hardware).

## How it works?

- World ID lives in the user's device. Generated by the user's device when they create an account.
- Whenever a World ID is used, ZKPs are generated on device.
- The source of truth is the World ID Protocol which lives on chain.
- Conceptual diagram.
  - App requests sign in with World ID or anonymous action
  - World App generates ZKP & User ID (called `nullifier_hash`)
  - App calls Developer Portal to verify
  - Dev Portal verifies with smart contract on-chain
  - Verified / not verified
- The User ID (nullifier hash) will always be the same for the same World ID and the same app. Apps can treat it as a unique user identifier. Yet this identifier is privacy preserving as it is not shared across applications. Every application will get a different ID and IDs are unlinkable except to the user.

## Developer Portal

- The Developer Portal helps manage actions and apps. Apps are registered here.
- The Developer Portal is the easiest way to verify World ID proofs, as it abstracts the complexity of verifying information on-chain.
- The Developer Portal is the Identity Provider (IdP) for Sign in with World ID.

## Proof-of-Personhood

- App also receives information on the verified credentials authorized by the user.
- App can use the Orb credential to assert someone is a human. For example it can be used so a user can only create one account.
- Orb credential asserts humanness and can be used for uniqueness.
- For anonymous actions, using the Orb credential with the unique user ID can be used to ensure someone is doing an action only once.
  - Voting example. App = app_1234; Action = vote_proposal_1 -> nullifier_hash=0x123

## Enrollment

- Getting a World ID can be as easy as downloading the World App and creating an account.
  - In the future, other clients will support World ID.
- The user can then add credentials to their World ID. Currently two credentials are supported.
- Credentials are issued by third-parties, not the Protocol. Currently the phone & Orb credentials are issued by TFH
