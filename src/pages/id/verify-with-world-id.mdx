# Verify with World ID

"Verify with World ID" is the recommended flow for your World ID integration, providing the most flexibility and the least amount of friction for your users.

Users should first create an account with your service, and then verify that account with World ID. This allows for existing users to seamlessly upgrade their account by verifying, and for new users to create an account and verify all at once.

## Integration

"Verify with World ID" can be implemented either with [Sign In with World ID](/id/sign-in) or [Incognito Actions](/id/incognito-actions). The user flow is the same for both, but the implementation is slightly different.

### When to use Sign In with World ID
You should use **Sign In with World ID** if you already allow users to sign in with other identity providers and link multiple accounts together. For example, if a user can sign in to a single account with either an email and password or a Google account, you should use Sign In with World ID.
The user should be able to add Sign In with World ID as a new login method to their existing account, or first create an account with Sign In with World ID and then link other sign in methods to that same account.

<Note>Applications using Auth0 for managing sign in can easily add Sign In with World ID as a new login method. See [Auth0's documentation on User Account Linking](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-account-linking) and our [Auth0 Integration](https://worldcoin.org/auth0) for more details.</Note>

### When to use Incognito Actions
You should use **Incognito Actions** if you do not want to allow users to sign in using their World ID. In this case, you should use Incognito Actions to verify the user's existing account from a setting menu or prompt them for verification when they first sign in.

<Note>Incognito Actions are very flexible and can be used to verify for multiple one-time actions. Read our [Incognito Actions documentation](/id/incognito-actions) for more details.</Note>
