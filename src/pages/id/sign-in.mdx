# Sign In with World ID

To better serve all classes of applications, World ID can now be used as an OpenID Connect Provider (Identity Provider, IdP, OP). We support many of the same integrations that developers are already familiar with (Auth0, Cloudflare, etc.). The following diagram outlines the general authentication flow for an integrating app:

![TODO]

If your app already supports OIDC, simply add our [discovery document](/.well-known/openid-configuration) as an authentication option. You can read more about our implementation under the [`/authorize`](#/authorize) and [`/token`](#/token) headings.

## Registration

Before OIDC authentication can take place, developers must register their applications with Worldcoin. This is a one-time action. There are two ways to accomplish this:

1. Create a new application on the [Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org)
2. Use the `/register` endpoint, request body details can be [found here](#/register)

During registration, you will need to provide the following values:

- `redirect_uris`: **Required**, list of approved websites the user can be redirected to after successful authentication.
- `client_name`: **Optional**, the name of the application that's displayed to users
- `logo_url`: **Optional**, the logo of the application that's displayed to users
- `application_type`: **Optional**, one of "web" or "mobile". Defaults to "web"
- `grant_types`: **Optional**, the type of flows this application will use. Can include "authorization_code", "implicit", or "hybrid". Defaults to "authorization_code"
- `response_type`: **Optional**, the response type expected by the application. Can include any of "code", "token", or "id_token". Defaults to "code"

<Callout type="info">
  All redirect URIs must be over HTTPS, and contain no port numbers or URL
  fragments. `localhost` can be used on staging apps for testing, but will not
  work on production apps.
</Callout>{' '}

After registration is complete, you will have a valid `app_id` that will be needed for every other step in the authentication process. This value is equivelent to `client_id` from the [OIDC specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest)

## Flows

World ID supports the [authorization code](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth), [implicit](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitFlowAuth), and [hybrid](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#HybridFlowAuth) flows from the OIDC spec. Applications can use any one of these flows to authenticate users.

_Generally_, applications should implement the authorization code flow, as it is more secure than the implicit flow. Applications without backend servers (that may be runing purely client-side) are more suited to implicit authentication.

## Authentication

All attempts at authentication begin with a request to the `/authorize` endpoint. Request details can be [found here](#/authorize).

### Hosted Sign In with World ID

When using the native Sign In with World ID page, much of the OIDC process is handled for you. You can begin the authentication cycle by redirecting your users to:

`https://id.worldcoin.org/authorize?client_id={app_id}&response_type={code|token|id_token}&redirect_uri={encoded_redirect_url}&state={state_value}&nonce={nonce_value}`

Example values could be:

- `client_id`: "app_123456", obtained from registration step
- `response_type`: "code%20id_token", valid response types from OIDC spec
- `redirect_uri`: "https%3A%2F%2Fapp.example.com%2Flogin", must be on the approved redirect URI list from registration
- `state`: "session_123", unique value used to track a user's session
- `nonce`: "1234567890", random value to verify id_token's authenticity

The user will then authenticate with their World ID via the World app. Once successfully authorized, the user is redirected back to your application. The redirect URL will contain a number of values, depending on the flow you are using.

### Redirect Responses

If using the default authorization code flow, the redirect URL will contain the following params:

- `code`: An authorization code that can be exchanged for an ID token
- `state`: The optional state value passed to the `/authorize` endpoint

If you received a response containing an _authorization code_, you must exchange it for an ID token on the `/token` endpoint. Request details can be [seen here](#/token).

If using implicit flow, the redirect URL will contain the following params:

- `id_token`: A signed JWT identifying the user, and any requested scope information

<Callout type="caution">
  ID tokens must always be verified, and should not be blindly accepted!
</Callout>

To verify an ID token, fetch the public key from the `/jwks` endpoint. You can read more about this process at the [Auth0 blog](https://auth0.com/blog/navigating-rs256-and-jwks/) or [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/), but one example method could be:

```ts
import * as jose from 'jose'

const verifyJwt = (token: string) => {
  const JWKS = jose.createRemoteJWKSet(new URL('https://id.worldcoin.org/jwks'))

  const { payload, header } = await jose.jwtVerify(token, JWKS, {
    issuer: 'https://id.worldcoin.org',
    audience: 'https://app.example.com',
  })

  return payload
}

verifyJwt('eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...')
```

### Custom Sign In

Since all technologies associated with World ID are open source, you can implement your own hosted version of IDKit to redirect your users to. Advanced API details for this implementation can be found below.
