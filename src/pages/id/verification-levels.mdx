# Verification Levels

The World ID Protocol supports multiple levels of verification, each with a different level of assurance that the user is a unique human. 

## Available Verification Levels

This list will continue to grow as more verification levels are supported for proof of personhood in the World ID Protocol.

### World ID Orb

World ID Orb is the strongest verification level currently available in World ID. It's a biometric verification that relies on the user visiting a World ID Orb, which verifies that the user is a unique human while preserving their privacy.

### World ID Device

World ID Device is replacing the previous `phone` credential in World ID. World ID Device relies on the user's identity wallet, such as World App, to verify a user's unique device.

The premise of World ID Device is users having a unique mobile device. This is more scalable, user friendly, and privacy-preserving than the previous `phone` credential, which was issued when a user verified their phone number in World App.

## When to use World ID Device vs. Orb

World ID Device offers an assurance that's convenient for a user to obtain, but it also provides a weaker level of resistance to Sybil attacks than World ID's Orb credential. It's best used for applications that only require a moderate level of sybil resistance or have a significant user base in regions where the Orb is not available.

We recommend requiring World ID Orb in instances where users are given a financial incentive, such as a signup bonus or airdrop. For other situations, such as a social media app, it may be sufficient to only require World ID Device. An application can always react according to the verification level used, e.g. when an Orb-verified user performs an action that requires World ID Device.
