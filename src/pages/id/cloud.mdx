# Verifying Proofs via API

This section describes how to verify proofs via the **Developer Portal API**.

<Note type="warning">
  You must first pass the proof to your backend when verifying proofs via the API. The user can manipulate information in the frontend, so you the proof must be verified in a trusted environment.
</Note>

Our backend should receive the `proof`, `merkle_root`, `nullifier_hash`, and `verification_level` from IDKit, as well as the same `action` and `signal` as were input into IDKit, and send it to the **Developer Portal API** for verification. 
The **Developer Portal API** will return a `200` response if the proof is valid, and a `400` response with extra error detail if the proof is invalid.
We then pass the success or error messages back to our frontend after performing our own backend actions.

```typescript {{ title: 'pages/api/verify.ts' }}
export type VerifyReply = {
  code: string;
  detail?: string;
};

export default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse<VerifyReply>) {
  const reqBody = {
    merkle_root: req.body.merkle_root,
    nullifier_hash: req.body.nullifier_hash,
    proof: req.body.proof,
    verification_level: req.body.verification_level,
    action: req.body.action, // or get this from environment variables,
    signal: req.body.signal ?? "", // if we don't have a signal, use the empty string
  };
  fetch(`https://developer.worldcoin.org/api/v1/verify/${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WLD_APP_ID}`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(reqBody), 
  }).then((verifyRes) => {
    verifyRes.json().then((wldResponse) => {
      if (verifyRes.status == 200) {
        // this is where you should perform backend actions based on the verified credential
        // i.e. setting a user as "verified" in a database
        res.status(verifyRes.status).send({ code: "success" });
      } else {
        // return the error code and detail from the World ID /verify endpoint to our frontend
        res.status(verifyRes.status).send({ 
          code: wldResponse.code, 
          detail: wldResponse.detail 
        });
      }
    });
  });
}
```

## Post-Verification

If `handleVerify` is does not throw an error, the user will see a success state and the `onSuccess` callback will be called when the modal is closed. The `onSuccess` callback should redirect a user to a success page, or perform any other actions you want to take after a user has been verified.

```tsx {{ title: 'pages/index.tsx' }}
const onSuccess = (result: ISuccessResult) => {
  // This is where you should perform frontend actions once a user has been verified
  window.alert(`Successfully verified with World ID!
    Your nullifier hash is: ` + result.nullifier_hash);
};
```
