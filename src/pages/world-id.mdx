World ID is a digital identity solution enabling users to prove their uniqueness and humanity anonymously via [zero-knowledge proofs](/further-reading/zero-knowledge-proofs) and advanced privacy-preserving cryptography.

Developers can easily integrate World ID into their apps, whether in the cloud or on-chain. World ID holders can easily and anonymously verify they are a unique human through a compatible identity wallet, like [World App](https://worldcoin.org/download).

### Why?

Existing identity solutions are broken. They are either too centralized, too invasive, or too insecure. World ID is a privacy-preserving, decentralized, and robust identity solution that is easy to use and integrate.

Users never need to share personal information to use World ID -- no government IDs, no emails, no social profiles, no names. They can prove they are a unique human without revealing their identity to anyone, **not even Worldcoin's core contributors.**
