# Integration

<Note>
    This guide assumes you have already completed the steps to [set up the Developer Portal](/quick-start/dev-portal).
</Note>

World ID can be used as an authentication mechanism. If you already have an OIDC-compatible authentication engine, you can integrate Sign In with Worldcoin using the steps below.

<Note>
  Typical OIDC-compatible authentication engines include
  [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), [CloudFlare
  Access](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/access/),
  [OneLogin](https://www.onelogin.com/) and many more. Most languages and
  frameworks have simple open source packages for this. 
  
  Follow our guides for Auth0 and NextAuth.js in the [Sign In Quick Start](/quick-start/sign-in) section.
</Note>
<Note type="warning">
  If you don't have an authentication engine, you can implement OIDC flows yourself. See the [OIDC Explainer](/further-reading/oidc-explainer) and [Sign In Reference](/reference/sign-in) for details.
</Note>

## Configure your auth engine

Configure your OIDC authentication engine to use World ID as an Identity Provider (IdP), you will need the following information:

- **Discovery endpoint**: `https://id.worldcoin.org/.well-known/openid-configuration` (if supported by your OIDC client engine, this will set everything automatically, continue below otherwise)

### Required inputs

- **Client ID**: your app id from the Developer Portal (e.g. {/* cSpell:disable */}`app_GBkZ1KlVUdFTjeMXskrX`{/* cSpell:enable */}).
- **Client secret**: app secret, obtained from the "Sign In" tab in the Developer Portal (e.g. `sk_6f07e1566ee4b765fe23d8c8`).
- **Authorize endpoint**: `https://id.worldcoin.org/authorize`
- **Response type**: depends on how you want to authenticate, follow the recommendations of your engine. We recommend auth code flow for server-side apps and implicit flow for client-side apps
  - Supported response types: `code` (authorization flow), `id_token` (implicit flow), `token`, or a combination of them (hybrid flow).

### Optional inputs

- **(Optional for implicit flow). Token endpoint**: `https://id.worldcoin.org/token`
- **(Optional). User info endpoint**: `https://id.worldcoin.org/userinfo`
- **(Optional). Introspect endpoint**: `https://id.worldcoin.org/introspect`

Once you have configured this, you can start the authentication flow from your app or authentication engine.

<Note>
  This will use the default World ID login page. If you instead want to build your own authentication page, check out the [Sign In Widget](/advanced/sign-in-widget) page in the Advanced Use Cases section.
