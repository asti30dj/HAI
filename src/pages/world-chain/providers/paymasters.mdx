# Paymasters

## Alchemy

[Alchemy Paymasters](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/what-is-a-paymaster) are smart contracts that enable decentralized
applications (dApps) to implement flexible gas policies, including: 
- Sponsoring gas fees for users
- Accepting gas payments in ERC-20 tokens instead of native blockchain currency

### Supported Networks

- World Chain

## Biconomy (Coming soon)

[Biconomy Paymasters](https://www.biconomy.io/) abstract gas complexities and improve user experience for Web3 applications by allowing developers to sponsor gas fees for users,
enable gas payments in any ERC-20 token and implement flexible gas policies.

## Pimlico (Coming soon)

[Pimlico](https://pimlico.io/) offers two types of paymasters to abstract away gas fees for users in the ERC-4337 ecosystem.
A verifying aymaster allows developers to sponsor on-chain gas fees for users, it utilizes an off-chain Pimlico balance
loaded through a dashboard and an ERC-20 paymaster which is a permissionless on-chain smart contract that enables users
to pay gas fees using their ERC-20 tokens and operates without requiring developer intervention.

Pimlico's paymasters can be seamlessly integrated with [permissionless.js](https://docs.pimlico.io/permissionless) (which also support alternative paymasters like Biconomy), a TypeScript library built on viem for ERC-4337 development.
