# Data Indexing and Analytics

Data indexing solutions and other APIs streamline access to blockchain data, enabling efficient querying and real-time analysis of on-chain events. 
This is crucial for decentralized applications built on World Chain, as it reduces the cost of processing, and presenting data. APIs also facilitate 
third-party integration, enhancing developer experiences and expanding the ecosystem with more accessible, decentralized apps (dApps) and services.

## Dune

[Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/) is a blockchain data platform that enables users to query, visualize, and share insights from on-chain data.
It provides a powerful interface for querying blockchain information using SQL-like queries, allowing users 
to create custom dashboards and visualizations.

Dune’s enhanced data accessibility and insights will give developers and non-developers on World Chain the
ability to:
- Explore metrics related to real humans interacting on the chain
- Track the performance of DeFi protocols and DEXes
- Explore onchain data of any public blockchain project

With Dune’s comprehensive dataset and web-based app, anyone (with a little SQL knowledge) may quickly query World Chain data and create insightful dashboards.
