# Superchain Bridges

The Superchain bridge is the native bridge for World Chain as it comes with the OP Stack smart contracts which power the network.
There are several interface providers for this bridge and it allows users to bridge assets from Ethereum mainnet and onto World Chain and vice versa.

## Alchemy Bridge

[Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/) is the rollup as a service (RaaS) provider for World Chain. As part of this service it also provides a 
World Chain bridge interface for users to deposit to and withdraw assets from the network.

## Superbridge Core

[Superbridge.app](https://superbridge.app/world-chain) is a blockchain bridging platform that enables users to transfer Ethereum (ETH)
 and ERC20 tokens between different blockchain networks, primarily focusing on OP Stack Layer 2 rollups chains including 
 the World Chain network.

# Third-party bridges

## Across

[Across](https://app.across.to/bridge?) is an intent-based cross-chain bridging protocol that allows users to transfer tokens between different blockchain networks,
 particularly focusing on Layer 2 solutions and Ethereum-compatible chains. TODO: Add link for World Chain.

## Hyperlane

[Hyperlane](https://hyperlane.xyz/) provides fast token bridging capabilities on World Chain and expands access to World ID on external chains.
