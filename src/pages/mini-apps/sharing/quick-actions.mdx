# Quick Actions

### **What Are Quick Actions?**

A Quick Action is a universal link defined by a schema that triggers a specific flow in your app natively.
It facilitates direct integrations between mini apps, enabling one app (App A) to utilize a feature or action of another app (App B) seamlessly.

<Note type="info">
	If a user clicks on your link and has World App installed, it will automatically open the mini app inside of World
	App to the specified path. Otherwise, it will direct them to the app store and prompt them to install World App.
</Note>

### **Benefits of Quick Actions**

1. **Time Efficiency**: Avoid the need to develop complex features from scratch.
2. **Leverage Expertise**: Utilize tools from apps that specialize in specific functionalities.
3. **Improved User Experience**: Provide a seamless flow between apps.
4. **Resource Optimization**: Focus on your apps core functionalities while outsourcing supplementary features.
5. **Mini app interoperability**: Leverage the user flow of other apps to attract and retain new users.
6. **Community Growth**: Quick Actions foster community growth by encouraging collaboration. For example, integrating another apps functionality opens opportunities for co-marketing, enhancing visibility and fostering ecosystem-wide collaboration.
