# Quick Actions

### **What Are Quick Actions?**

A Quick Action is a universal link defined by a schema that triggers a specific flow in your app natively.
It facilitates direct integrations between mini apps, enabling one app (App A) to use a feature or action of another app (App B) seamlessly.

<Note type="info">
	If a user clicks on your link and has World App installed, it will automatically open the mini app inside of World
	App to the specified path. Otherwise, it will direct them to the app store and prompt them to install World App.
</Note>

### **Benefits of Quick Actions**

1. **Leverage Expertise**: Use other mini apps already working specific features.
2. **Resource & Time Optimization**: Focus on your apps core functionalities while outsourcing supplementary features.
3. **Community Growth**: Integrating another apps functionality opens opportunities for co-marketing.
