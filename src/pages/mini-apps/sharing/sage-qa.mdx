## Getting Started

### 1. Create a Sage Developer project

Go to the [Sage Developer dashboard](https://dev-dashboard-gamma.vercel.app/) and sign in. Create a new project.

### 2. Customising Sage to fit your app

With a project created, head over to the project’s settings, this page is accessible by going into: **Apps > Your App > Settings**. (Navigation is available through the menu bar on the top right or  the top left breadcrumbs)

In this page you can find parameters to fine tune Sage to best interact with your users in the context of your app, a comprehensive description of these parameters is present [below](#sage-dev-app-settings).

### 3. Integrating Sage Support in your app

The final step to integrating Sage Support into your React application is to install and make use of the `SageSupport` component.

Add the npm package with the command:

```bash
npm install sage-support
```

Once the dependency installed, the simplest way to integrate Sage Support is:

```tsx
import { SageSupport } from 'sage-support';

<SageSupport projectId={YOUR_APP_ID} />
```

Where `YOUR_APP_ID` is the App ID (number) you can find in the Sage Developer Dashboard (top right).

More configuration options for the component are available [below](#sage-support-component).

### Analytics

Once you’ve started using Sage Support in your Mini App, analytics are also available in the Sage Developer Dashboard, allowing you to identify the usage of Sage Support in your app and understand how users are using it. You can find more information about analytics [below](#sage-dev-app-analytics).

## Sage Dev App Settings

Located at **Apps > Your App > Settings**, the Settings page allows you to fine tune the Sage Support assistant to meet the needs and context of your Mini App.

### `App Name`

This name only lives in the Sage Developer dashboard universe and serves the purpose of differentiating between multiple Sage Support integrations, it’s recommended that this field is set accordingly.

### `App ID`

Uniquely identifies your Sage Developer App and is used to link your `SageSupport` component to the Sage Developer dashboard. This field is automatically generated and cannot be changed.

### `Introduction Message`

Defines the first message to be sent by the Sage assistant once a new chat is created/open by a user. This field is also capable of encompassing a custom variable (`%USER%`) which Sage will replace by the user’s username.

### `App Description`

Provide a solid description about your app and what it focuses on, this field is processed by Sage as an additional context parameter, and is useful to keep the assistant behaviour and subject within the landscape of your Mini App.
