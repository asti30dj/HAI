# Promotion

The App Store will be a powerful distribution channel for your mini app. To help the ecosystem grow, we will be introducing 3 programs to help you get started.

## App of the Week
Each week we will highlight a different mini app that showcases an outstanding usecase and developer effort. 
This will be featured on the Worldcoin App Store homepage and in the Worldcoin App Store app. Learn about how we evaluate which apps to feature,
and how you can increase your chances of being selected.

    <p>The app of the week will get a prominent content card showcasing their app</p>

## Fast Grants
To help you get started, we will be creating a streamlined fast grants program for developers who are building mini apps. Developers can use this to 
help fund their development costs, marketing, or other expenses. To learn more email andy@toolsforhumanity.com. Our public application will be available soon.


## Marketing
Occasionally we will run marketing campaigns to promote mini apps. This could be through social media, email, or other channels. For more information please
