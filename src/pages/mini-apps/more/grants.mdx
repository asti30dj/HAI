# Grants

## Fast Grants Program
The Fast Grants program offers grants in the range of $1-5k and are available
to US citizens as well. We aim to provide a decision within 48 hours of application. These grants are aimed to help developers build their MVPs.

## Foundation Grants

In addition to Fast Grants you can apply for Foundation Grants. These grants are larger and have a formal review process.
The Foundation is dedicating 50M WLD to support novel mini apps. 

It is encouraged to first have an MVP of your product before applying for a Foundation Grant.
Receiving a Fast Grant does not disqualify you from applying for a Foundation Grant, in fact it is encouraged to apply for a Fast Grant first.
