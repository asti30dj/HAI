# Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble with your mini-app, here are some common issues and solutions.
### **Triggering a command on initialize**

**Problem:** Since we use a client side component to install the minikit provider onto the `Window` object.
If you try to trigger a command seperately as soon as the page opens via a separate `useEffect` hook 
it can result in a race condition where minikit is not yet installed when you call the command.

**Fix:** If you wish to call a command on open include the command inside the same `useEffect` hook you use to install Minikit.
```tsx {{ title: '/components/MiniKitProvider.tsx' }}
"use client";

import { MiniKit } from "@worldcoin/minikit-js";
import { useEffect, ReactNode } from "react";

export const MiniKitProvider = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    MiniKit.install();

    // Add any commands you wish to trigger on start here to prevent race conditions
    MiniKit.commands.walletAuth({
      // ...
    })
  }, []);

  return <>{children}</>;
};


```
