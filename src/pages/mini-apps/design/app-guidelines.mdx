# Guidelines
These guidelines are meant to help you succeed as a mini app developer.

## MiniKit Integration

Apps should integrate with MiniKit. MiniKit supercharges your web application into a mini app with features that
are not available anywhere else. Specifically, **World ID** and **Wallet** access. Thinking through how your app can leverage these features will help you succeed
and make your application much more interesting to users. 


## Mobile First

Mini apps are inherently access via mobile. Your application UI should look and feel like an app.
This includes tab navigation, snap to text boxes, no footers, no sidebars, 
minimal scrolling, no hamburger menus, and smooth transitions.
<div className='grid grid-cols-2'>
    <div className='grid justify-items-center text-center'>
        <video className="m-auto" width="300" autoPlay muted loop playsInline>
            <source src="/images/docs/mini-apps/guidelines/bad-compressed.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
        ❌ Bad Example <br/> Footer and long scrolling
    </div>
    <div className='grid justify-items-center text-center'>
        <video className="m-auto" width="300"  autoPlay muted loop playsInline>
            <source src="/images/docs/mini-apps/guidelines/good-compressed.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
        ✅ Good Example <br/> Bottom tab navigation and anchored buttons
    </div>

## Localisation
Many of our users are located around the world. Apps that are localised for each region will perform significantly better. 
You can recognize the user's locale by using the <Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language">Accept-Language</Link> header

These languages are particularly important given our users:
1. English
2. Spanish
3. Japanese
4. Korean


## Usernames
You should never display the user's wallet address, instead use their username.
Usernames are our ENS compatible username for every World App user. See the <Link href="https://usernames.worldcoin.org/docs">docs</Link> on how to implement.


## Using the Address Book
World ID inherently allows anonmyity between applications. We generally encourage
developers to use their own Verify Command and verify the proof. However, we also offer a World ID
address book. This contract stores a mapping `addressVerifiedUntil` you can query to see if a World App
address is World ID Orb verified.

## Design Patterns
Here are some design patterns that we recommend you follow:
1. Wallet Auth -> Show Usernames
2. Wallet Auth -> Verify Command
3. Wallet Auth -> Resolve verification via Address Book

If you use Sign in with World ID you should not be doing any transactions with the user's wallet address. Instead, you should be using the username.
Sign in with World ID and Verify offer the same World ID guarantees, but Verify is more reliable.
