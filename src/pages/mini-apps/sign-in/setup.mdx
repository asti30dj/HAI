# Sign In

Sign in with World ID will be natively supported inside of World App. You do not need to do any custom implentation 
to be compatible as a mini app. 

<Note type="warning">
	Currently World App expects a nonce for all OIDC methods. This will be fixed in the future, but as a workaround we strongly recommend using a library that supports nonce checks for all logins, such as NextAuth. If you have questions please reach out before implementation.
