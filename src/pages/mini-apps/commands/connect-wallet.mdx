# Connect Wallet

Wallet auth returns a wallet address upon completion. If you don't want to use SIWE and just want the wallet address, 
just use the `walletAuth` command and skip the verification of the payload.

**Use Case:** This command is useful for applications that require user authentication via their Ethereum wallet,
allowing for secure access without traditional credentials.

**Example:** An app that allows users to manage their assets and trade tokens directly from their wallet without needing to create a separate account.
