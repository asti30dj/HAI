# Notifications

## Rules

Currently we only allow transactional notifications. No promotional notifications are allowed as of now.
We will closely monitor what notifications are sent, and revoke permissions if necessary.

## Best practices

-   use localized text - you can get it from the `x-accept-language` header,
-   make the notifications somewhat personalized, use the username instead of wallet address
